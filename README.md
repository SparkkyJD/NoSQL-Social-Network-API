## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Because they use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications.

Here i built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I used native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
